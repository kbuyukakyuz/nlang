# nlang
OK, I just made programming a language from scratch

nlang is a memory-safe & memory-efficient programming language written in pure C. nlang does not have any memory leaks and achieves memory safety via its garbage collector. Its compiler generates bytecode rather than native machine code and executes the instructions on its own virtual machine. Generated bytecode, as default, provided to end-user in a human-readable form before every execution in order to have a full track of instructions. Most of the complicated I/O functions are already provided and others will be implemented on a built-in facilities library.


An example of string literals, functional syntax for built-ins are optional
> print "this is a string!";
> print("this is a string!");

Both of them returns the same bytecode:
> == bytecode ==  
> 0000    1 OP_CONSTANT         0 'this is a string  
> 0002     |    OP_PRINT  
> 0003    2 OP_RETURN  
>        0000    1 OP_CONSTANT         0 'this is a string  
>        [ this is a string ]0002     |    OP_PRINT  
> this is a string  
>         0003    2 OP_RETURN
